## **Design**

### **Imagery**
<br>

![background image](/assets/screenshots/background-image3.jpg)<br>

* The background image is relevant to the theme of the site and was chosen over a plain colored background.
<br>

* The relevant question images are from Clipart Library

### **Typography**
<br>

![background image](/assets/screenshots/header-font.png)

* The header font Boogaloo was chosen as it is fun and visually striking. If the font isn't imported correctly, cursive will serve as fallback. 

### **Colors**
<br>

![answer buttons](/assets/screenshots/answer-buttons.png)

* The color scheme for the website was chosen to blend in with the background image. The answer buttons have a 2px solid (#ffffff) border and when hovered over, they change colors from (#goldenrod) to (#0a0500). The "start game" and "restart game" buttons are (#goldenrod) with a 2px solid (#ffffff) border also. A border radius of 10px was used on the buttons to blend in with the header font.
